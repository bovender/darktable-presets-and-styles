# Darktable presets and styles
Presets and styles for [Darktable][] from an amateur photographer and photo editor.

These are my own few presets and styles and they will grow over time.

This is heavily inspired by the work of [Boris Hajdukovic][] and his tutorials
on Youtube, but I would like to stress that these are neither officially Boris'
presets (as far as I know, he does not publish his presets), nor is this in any
way endorsed by Boris. In fact, while I follow him and admire his work, he does
not know me at all.

I put these presets and styles into the public domain (CC0 license) for others
to use and build upon.

Please note that I am really only an amateur and I am still learning to edit
photos with Darktable. If you are interested in these files, be aware that
these files may very well not meet your needs, lead to funny results, or just
simply be "wrong". So use at your own risk, but I hope this is helpful.

The main purpose of this repository is to keep track of my own editing skills,
and as an additional backup.

## Branches in this repository

I will keep branches named after the Darktable release versions that I had in
use when I created or updated the presets and styles. I will merge the current
versioned branch into `main` so that `main` always reflects the latest versions
of my presets.
